QUICK PLUGIN HOWTO
==================

You are reading the HOWTO.txt of the plugin skeleton.
Now, suppose you want to create the retriever ``FoozaRetriever``, that can
get lyrics
You should customize a bit this:

1. change the name of the package dir
    ``mv MyRetriever FoozaRetriever``

2. edit ``retriever.py`` inside that directory. You have to change:
    
    * class name. from ``class MyRetriever`` to ``class FoozaRetriever``
    * the name field. from ``name = 'My Retriever`` to ``name = 'Fooza Retriever'``
    * the features field: from ``features = ()`` to ``features = ('lyrics')``
    * Write working code in ``get_data``

That's it!
